# 3D-Designs
Hi! You're welcome to use any of the 3D files I made in Autodesk Fusion 360, just give me credit if you do!

These designs are made by the CEO of BitFix and are free for public use!
Only requirement is credit to Francisco A. Casiano Rosado if they are used!
I will normally add the Fusion 360 file along with an .x3g file for FlashForges, if you have a FlashForge your work has been cut in half! :D
List of models in this folder:
1. Laptop cooling arms
2. Surfboard fin
3. Note 5 CAD files
4. (Upcoming) Mod for Gigabot 3+ Off the grid mode
